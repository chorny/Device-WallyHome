=head1 NAME

Device::WallyHome::Place - WallyHome REST API Interface - Place

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # A Device::WallyHome::Place will always be instantiated from a base Device::WallyHome object.
    use Device::WallyHome;

    my $wally = Device::WallyHome->new(
        token => 'f4379e51-222f-4def-8ee1-edf0b15be3b8',
    );

    my $place = $wally->getPlaceById('qyWIClYakQX8TQxtFv1ypN6c');

    # Get a list (ArrayRef) of all sensors
    my $sensors = $place->sensors();

    # Get a single Device::WallyHome::Sensor object by Sensor ID (snid)
    my $sensor = $place->getSensorBySnid();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Device::WallyHome::Place> represents a child class of the L<Device::WallyHome>
Perl5 interface for the WallyHome REST API.

Device::WallyHome::Place objects are returned from various methods via
a parent L<Device::WallyHome> object and are not intended to be instantiated
directly.


=head2 Methods

=over

=item B<sensors>

    my $sensors = $place->sensors();

Returns a list of all sensors associated with the given place.  Each
sensor returned is a L<Device::WallyHome::Sensor> object.

=item B<getSensorBySnid>

    my $sensor = $place->getSensorById('90-7a-f1-ff-ff-ff');

Returns a single L<Device::WallyHome::Sensor> object matching the passed
sensor identifier (snid).  If no matching sensor is found, C<undef> will
be returned.

=back


=head1 EXAMPLES

    # Iterate through a list of sensors, printing the identifier and current temperature for each
    foreach my $sensor (@$sensors) {
        printf("%s - %0.2f\n", $sensor->snid(), $sensor->state('TEMP')->value());
    }
